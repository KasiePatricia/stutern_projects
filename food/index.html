            <h2>About my Favourite food (Abacha)</h2>
            <p>African salad (Abacha food) is a delicious west African food that is native to the ndi Igbo (people of Igbo). I can prepare this delicacy within 15 minutes and it requires just cassava flakes, palm oil, crayfish, ugba and some other spices.Abacha is very popular in the eastern part of Nigeria; it is one of the most Popular Igbo Foods; I don't visit Eastern part of the country and come back without having a taste of this Nigerian delicacy.</p>
            <p>Abacha as the Igbos love to call it is one of the most popular food in the eastern Nigeria, it serves best as kola to visitors. There are villages in the eastern part of Nigeria that only offer ugba or abacha to visitors and even visitors love and desire the delicious delicacy.</p>

            <h2>Steps/ Methods to prepare Abacha</h2>
            <h3>Getting the main ingredients (Abacha) ready</h3>
            <p>The fresh Abacha (African salad is a by-product of cassava). There are a lot of processes involved with obtaining the fresh abacha that is used in preparing the African salad that we all know. Most rural dwellers are very familiar with turning cassava tubers into dried abacha that is used for this recipe.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first thing to do (if you live in the village or own a farm) is to get cassava tubers.</li>
                <li>Wash thoroughly and boil along with water for twenty to thirty minutes then pill to remove the brown outer layer, and cut to tiny bits.</li>
                <li>I then soaked the sliced cassava in water for 18 hours. The last thing to do would be to wash thoroughly with clean water then sun-dry and store in an airtight container.</li>
                <li>Dried cassava chips can last more than a year if stored in an air tight dry environment.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The main procedure</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat or soak the dry Abacha in boiled water for about three minutes, then sieve and keep on a separate bowl.</li>
                <li>Blend your crayfish and also slice the onions, garden egg leaves.</li>
                <li>Dissolve the powdered potash in about half a cup of clean water, this is a trick I employ just filter out unwanted solid materials that are often embedded in potash.</li>
                <li>Filter the dissolved potash into a mortar or pot, leaving out the residue.</li>
                <li>Add about 100ml of palm oil and stir to form a yellowish paste (ncha, as addressed by the igbos)</li>
                <li> Then add the ground crayfish and pepper, stir, then add the ground ehu if you like.</li>
                <li>Add the ugba to the mixture and stir, and then add the abacha, salt.</li>
                <li>heat the abacha just a few seconds before you use so it doesn't get cold.</li>
                <li>Stir the whole combination and you are almost through with the preparation part.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>The toppings</h4>
            <p>The garden eggs, the leaves, and the onions are used to spice up or for decoration and not added during preparation but while dishing out. They sliced and kept aside in different plates or bowls, then added while I dish individual plates out; this also goes for the meat or fish used. Serve with the meat and also add the garden eggs (sliced) and leaves to individual plate.</p>
